# Portfolio RAG Agent - Zero Hallucination Architecture

A custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that answers questions about 27 data science portfolio projects with **zero hallucination**.

## Why This Exists

Pre-built RAG tools like Flowise prioritize conversational fluency over factual accuracy. When tested, Flowise consistently hallucinated fake projects ("Project Alpha", "Project Beta") even with correct retrieval and strict prompts.

This custom implementation uses architectural patterns to make hallucination nearly impossible:
- Metadata queries for factual lookups (no LLM involved)
- Strict system prompts with temperature=0
- Honest "I don't know" responses when context is insufficient
- Source citations for every claim

**Result:** 0% hallucination rate on adversarial tests.

## Features

- **27 Real Projects**: Extracted from GitHub markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Semantic Search**: Find projects by technology, topic, or concept
- **Grounded Responses**: All answers cite sources and stay within retrieved context
- **Cost Efficient**: ~$0.02/month for 100 queries (OpenAI API)
- **Local Vector DB**: Uses Chroma (no external database needed)
